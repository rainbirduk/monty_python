The game runs like this:
1. The contestant first chooses a box but does not open it
2. The host gives a hint that is neither the winning box nor the initial choice
3. The contestant decides whether or not to switch their choice to the remaining box
4. Their final choice box is opened to reveal the outcome of the game

Standard assumptions:
- The prize is equally likely to be behind any door.
- The host will always open a box that the contestant did not choose.
- The host will always reveal an empty box and never the winning box.
- If the contestant's first choice is correct, the host will always reveal from the remaining boxes at random.
