The game runs like this:
1. The contestant first chooses a door but does not open it
2. The host gives a hint by opening a door that is neither the winning door nor the initial choice
3. The contestant decides whether stick with their initial choice switch to the remaining door
4. Their final choice door is opened to reveal the outcome of the game

Standard assumptions:
- The prize is equally likely to be behind any door
- The host will always open a door that the contestant did not choose
- The host will always reveal an empty door and never the winning door
- If the contestant's first choice is correct, the host will always reveal from the remaining doors at random
