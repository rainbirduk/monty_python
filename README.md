# Monty Python: A Monty Hall Simulation Tool

This Python-based project provides a modular, interactive, and testable implementation of the classic Monty Hall problem. It includes simulation capabilities, user-guided gameplay, and automated report generation.

## Project Overview

The Monty Hall problem is a probability puzzle based on a game show scenario. This suite allows users to:
- Play the game interactively
- Run large-scale simulations
- Generate PDF reports of results
- Explore and test core logic functions

## Scripts

`main_script.py`: Entry point for running the program.  
`menu_functions.py`: Contains functions for navigating menus and handling user selections. Coordinates modules and user flow.
`monty_hall_functions.py`: Core logic for simulating the Monty Hall game, including door selection and switching mechanics. 
`monty_hall_functions_test.py`: Unit tests and debugging outputs for validating the core Monty Hall logic. 
`play_monty_hall.py`: Interactive walkthrough of the game, allowing users to play through with guided prompts. 
`print_and_input_functions.py`: Utility functions for formatted output and input handling, enhancing user experience during interactive play. 
`run_user_simulation.py`: Runs batch simulations of the Monty Hall game, useful for statistical analysis and strategy testing. 
`report_generator.py`: Generates PDF reports summarizing simulation results, including win/loss statistics and strategy comparisons.
